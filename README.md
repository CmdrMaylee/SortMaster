# SortMaster

A web/mobile app that teaches about sorting algorithms and present it in an edutainment way, allowing the user to read about different kinds algorithms, the glossary of terms surrounding sorting, and test algorithms on their device to see how they work

## How to run

The program is separated into 3 projects: Backend, Frontend Web & Frontend Mobile.

Backend: Start with opening a terminal in "backend\src\" and running "dotnet run" to run a local instance of the backend(database uses SqlLite)
Frontend Web: Open a terminal window in "frontend web - vite\src\" and run the command "npm run dev" to initiate a local version of the web page.
Frontend Mobile: TBA.

## Essentials

The requirements that puts the foundation into the program over flavour is gonna be a way to initiate sorting attempts, see the result of an attempt, save a history of attempts and allow the user to see the full log of previous sortings(hence, the backend needs to be in place as well).

## Backend(BE)

I plan on writing the BE in .NET 7, as a fun experiment to see what new features can be learned. I have however not decided yet exactly how to model the backend in corrolation to FE, but I'll certainly have to do a bit of reading up to freshen my memory on such stacks.

## Frontend(FE)

As much as I stand against the makers of React + Native, I can't deny they are solid frameworks for building solid app solutions. With that said, I'll make a simple React Native mobile app, with React via Vite for web.
